# 🚀 Two Pointers Technique Lecture

## 🧠 1. Introduction
The Two Pointers technique is a powerful method used in algorithm design to solve problems involving linear data structures such as arrays or linked lists. It uses two indices (or pointers) that move through the data structure in a coordinated way to accomplish a task efficiently.

### 🧭 Two Pointers Strategy Types

#### 🔁 A. Inward (Opposite Ends)
Two pointers start at both ends of the array and move toward the center.
- 📌 **Use Case:** Finding a pair with a given sum in a sorted array.

#### 🪝 B. Staged (Fixed + Moving)
One pointer is fixed, and the other scans or moves based on conditions.
- 📌 **Use Case:** Triple sum problems (3Sum), comparing elements after fixing one.

#### 🔂 C. Unidirectional (Same Direction)
Both pointers start from the beginning and move forward.
- 📌 **Use Case:** Moving non-zero elements forward in-place (e.g., Move Zeroes).

## 🧩 3. Pattern Examples

### 🔁 D. Inward: Valid Palindrome (🧼 Clean & Check)
```python
s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
filtered = [c.lower() for c in s if c.isalnum()]
left, right = 0, len(filtered) - 1
while left < right:
    if filtered[left] != filtered[right]:
        print(False)
        break
    left += 1
    right -= 1
else:
    print(True)
```
**🧼 Explanation:**
- Normalize the string: remove non-alphanumerics and convert to lowercase.
- Use two pointers from both ends to compare characters.
- If mismatch occurs, it's not a palindrome.
- Stops early on failure and returns True only if all characters match.

### 🔁 A. Inward: Two Sum II
```python
arr = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
while left < right:
    curr_sum = arr[left] + arr[right]
    if curr_sum == target:
        print(left, right)
        break
    elif curr_sum < target:
        left += 1
    else:
        right -= 1
```

### 🔂 B. Unidirectional: Move Zeroes (📚 Homework)
```python
nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
lastNonZeroFoundAt = 0
for current in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[current] != 0:
        nums[lastNonZeroFoundAt], nums[current] = nums[current], nums[lastNonZeroFoundAt]
        lastNonZeroFoundAt += 1
```

### 🪝 C. Staged: Triple Sum (🏫 In-Class Work)
```python
nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
nums.sort()
res = []
for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
    if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
        continue
    left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
        if total < 0:
            left += 1
        elif total > 0:
            right -= 1
        else:
            res.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
            while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:
                left += 1
            while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:
                right -= 1
            left += 1
            right -= 1
print(res)
```
